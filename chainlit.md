# Welcome to SQL Chatbot! ðŸ¤–

I can help you query your SQL Server database using natural language questions.



## Example Questions

- "How many transfers are there for company 1?"
- "Show me the most recent dispatched transfer"
- "Count how many transfers were received last month"
- "What's the average time between dispatch and receipt?"

I'll show you the SQL query I plan to run and then give you the results!
